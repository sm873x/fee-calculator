# fee-calculator
An assignment to practice basic JS skills by creating a calculator.

End of the First Week - Front End Engineering Course @ The Iron Yard

THIS remains burned into my memory as the moment when my brain had to work in a way
that I can't remember it ever working before. The first time where we had to break
each action into it's component parts and view the world as programmers. It was a
painful, but enlightening experience.

This was also our first partner programming exercise. Please see my partner Samina's repo
for our finished work:
